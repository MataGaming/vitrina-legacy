## Manual / FAQ

### Subreddits listing

#### `Add new subreddit`

Either by clicking the `plus icon` or the `search icon`.

#### `Reorder subreddits`

Use the `hamburger icon` in each list item.

#### `Delete subreddits`

Swipe left on the given list item. No confirmation message is shown.

#### `Minimum upvote count`

Specify a minimum number of upvotes (simply click to edit). Posts that have a lower score than that will not be shown.

### Settings

#### `Shuffle`

If enabled, the subreddit listing will be mixed together. Artworks will be chosen from all subreddits.

If disabled, artworks will be picked in the order they are specified on the listing page.

This is obvious.

It affects the autocomplete feature in the search and what artworks will be served as your background.
